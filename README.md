# XFEM Buckling Analysis

This MATLAB script performs an analysis of buckling and in-plane behavior of a graphene sheet, considering non-local effects using the XFEM (Extended Finite Element Method). 

## Introduction
The XFEM is a powerful numerical technique for analyzing complex phenomena such as crack propagation, material interfaces, and heterogeneous materials. In this context, the script is tailored to investigate the mechanical behavior of graphene sheets, which are essential components in various nanotechnology applications.

## Features
- **Buckling Analysis**: Computes critical buckling loads and corresponding mode shapes.
- **In-Plane Behavior**: Analyzes stress distribution and deformation characteristics.
- **Non-Local Effects**: Accounts for non-local material behavior to capture size-dependent effects.
- **Crack Geometry**: Handles crack geometry and interactions with the structure.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized into modular sections for clarity and flexibility.

## Usage
**Setup**: Define plate properties, crack geometry, and material properties.
**Boundary Conditions**: Specify boundary conditions and applied loads.
**Run Analysis**: Execute the script to perform buckling and in-plane analysis.
**Visualization**: Visualize results, including mode shapes, stress distributions, and critical buckling loads.

## Getting Started
- Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
- Open the MATLAB script `_XFEM_Buckling_Analysis.m`.
- Adjust parameters as needed for your specific analysis.
- Run the script and analyze the results.
